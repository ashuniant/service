# Service
An service caching utility for ROBLOX which goal is to achieve the best perfomance and experience, while working with services.

# Advantage
This utility allows to easily access any service, while keeping the typization for most of the game service and caching any service for future perfomance. Undefined services are usually defined as `Instance` to prevent any possible type errors.

# Usage
It's preferred to use the darklua tool while working with this utility, but as an exception there is a build version. <br />
The simplest example would be printing `LocalPlayer` name:
```lua
local service = require("@path/to/service")

local Players = service.Players
print(Players.LocalPlayer.Name)
```

# Advice
✅ Recommended to localize services, because this will save performance better than if it's done ONLY by a utility:
```lua
local service = require("@path/to/service")

local ReplicatedStorage = service.ReplicatedStorage
local Workspace = service.Workspace

print(`successfully fetched: {ReplicatedStorage}, {Workspace}`)
```
⚠️ Highly advised not to access the service every time, especially if you do it in some kind of loop, because the utility will process the cached services every time and this may cause some kind of deterioration in perfomance:
```lua
local service = require("@path/to/service")

while task.wait() do
    print(service.Workspace) -- this will cause perfomance issues.
end
```
